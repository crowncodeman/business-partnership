We're seeking a strategic partnership with a U.S. citizen software engineer to expand our client base within the United States. This collaboration aims to leverage our world-class technical abilities while meeting the hiring preferences of U.S. clients and companies, who often prioritize working with domestic talent.

The U.S. market is renowned for its competitive compensation and professional opportunities. However, many clients and organizations require developers to be U.S. citizens or residents. By partnering with a qualified U.S. software engineer, we can meet this requirement and unlock greater business potential together.
